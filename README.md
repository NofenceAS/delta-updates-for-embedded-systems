# About

This is a example program showcasing an implementation of [DETools](https://github.com/eerimoq/detools) for [Zephyr](https://www.zephyrproject.org/). It allows for incremental firmware updates, or [delta updates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_update), as an alternative to the standard procedure of downloading new firmware in its entirety. 

The program itself is a modification of the Zephyr sample program "Blinky" (which flashes LED 1 on the board), with the added functionality that When a button 1 is pressed, a the program checks for a new patch and, if such a patch exists, performs a firmware upgrade. A developer may easily modify the program code to make the application flash LED 2 instead, create a a patch with this change, download it to the board, push button 1, and confirm whether the upgrade was successful by checking which LED is flashing.

### Key features 
The program was created for my [bachelorÂ´s thesis](https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12380/302598), which one may look through for implementation details, descriptions of the algorithms used, methodology, and suggestions for further research, among other things. For a breif overview of some key features one may refer to the list below:

* The program is currently hardware specific and assumes the Nordic [nRF52840 DK](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/nrf52840-dk) SoC is used. However, it will likely very easily be ported to other [Zephyr supported boards](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/boards/index.html). 
* The delta encoding algorithm used is the DETools implementation of [BSDiff](http://www.daemonology.net/bsdiff/) using [heat-shrink](https://github.com/atomicobject/heatshrink) for compression. 
* The program utilizes the Device Firmware Upgrade features facilitated by the [MCUBoot](https://www.mcuboot.com/) bootloader, and is therefore dependent on its usage (MCUBoot is automatically included if one follows the environment set up steps below). Most notably it takes advantage of the [flash map layout](https://github.com/mcu-tools/mcuboot/blob/main/docs/readme-zephyr.md). 
* The patching process makes use of three partitions: the primary partition, the secondary partition, and the patch partition. The current firmware runs on the primary partition, the new firmware is created on the secondary partition, and the patch is downloaded to the patch partition. Naturally, this means that the size of the patch partition puts an upper limit to the size of the patch. When the new firmware has been created, the device requests a swap of the primary and the secondary partition and reboots, as in the [normal upgrade scanario](https://www.mcuboot.com/documentation/design/#high-level-operation).
* Creation of patches, downloading firmware to the device, building, and a few other things may easily be done using the make commands provided in the makefile. A full list of these commands can be acquired using `make help`.
* Limited testing has resulted in patch sizes of 1.6 to 6.4 percent of target image size depending on the types of changes made. However, more extended testing has to be performed in order to make any generalized claims.

### Purpose 
Many resource-constrained IoT units are used in a manner which makes them inaccessible via cable and at the same time unable to receive large amounts of data using radio transmissions. Upgrading firmware is hence difficult or in some cases impossible. Integrating support for delta updates in the unit is a potential solution to this problem, as it significantly reduces the payload during an upgrade scenario. However, as of now there is no open-source solution for delta upgrades in embedded systems. The purpose of the application is to such a solution is achievable and that it causes a significant payload reduction. 

# Environment Setup
Follow Zephyr's [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/getting_started/index.html) up to step 3.2 "Get the Zephyr source code". Here one should run the commands below instead of the ones in the guide:

    $ git clone https://gitlab.endian.se/thesis-projects/delta-updates-for-embedded-systems.git
    $ cd delta-updates-for-embedded-systems
    $ west init -l app/
    $ west update
    $ west zephyr-export
    $ pip3 install --user -r ./zephyr/scripts/requirements.txt

Then complete the remaining steps under section 4. Finally, run `make tools`.
