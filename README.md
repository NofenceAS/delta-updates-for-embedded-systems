# About
This is a short example program showcasing an implementation of [DETools](https://github.com/eerimoq/detools) for [Zephyr RTOS](https://www.zephyrproject.org/) which enables firmware patching. 

The program was created for my bachelors thesis, "Delta Updates for Embedded Systems". For a detailed description of the implementation, theoretical background, and suggestions for further research, one is encouraged to take a look at the [thesis report](https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12380/302598). However, a brief summary of some key features will be outlined below:
